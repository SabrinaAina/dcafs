INTRODUCTION OF DAHLIA PRE-SCHOOL FEEDBACK AND COMPLAINT SYSTEM

       The Dahlia Pre-School Feedback and Complaint System that will be developed is to upgrade the manual system 
with a more user-friendly computer system for managing feedback and complain data. This system will store feedback 
and complain information more effectively and systematically. So, the stored data can be managed consistently. 
This system may also be used to monitor and resolve complain matter. This can make it easy for user to make complain 
and feedback through this system. This also ensures that all documents are well-maintained, secure, and easily 
accessible when needed.
